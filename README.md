## Usage
### Create A New Game
To create your own game room, press the "Make Your Own Game" button on the Login page. You will be given a game code to share with your opponent. 

### Entering a Pre-existing Game
If given a game code, enter the code into the text box after "Enter Game Code Here:" and you will be able to join the game of your opponent. 

### Playing The Game
To move pieces, click your piece and then the square which you'd like your piece to move to.

## How the Code Works
### Selecting Pieces
After selecting a piece, the next tile selected sends a pair of (startposition, endposition) to determine if the move is valid. There is a check for promotion after move is done. This would make it an auto queen. 

### Determining if a move is valid
A lottta if statements if a turn can be transmitted at all on that side, if the piece selected is of the side of the client, and if it is a legal move of the piece selected.

### Color assignment
Colors are randomly assigned.
